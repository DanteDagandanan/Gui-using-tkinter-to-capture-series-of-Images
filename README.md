# Gui-using-tkinter-to-capture-series-of-Images

This code defines a GUI application using the tkinter library to capture images from a video source, display them in a canvas, and save them to a specified directory. The application consists of a main window with three frames: the left frame contains the canvas and a list of captured images, the bottom frame contains a button to capture an image and an entry field to specify the filename, and the right frame is currently empty. The application captures images from a video source (e.g., webcam), saves the images as PNG files to the specified directory with a filename that includes the current angle of the captured image, and displays the images in the listbox widget on the left side of the window. The user can select an image from the list to display its controls for opening and deleting the image. The code uses the OpenCV library to capture the images from the video source and the PIL library to display the images in the canvas.
